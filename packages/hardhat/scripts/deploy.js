According to trees.stanford.edu, there has been loss of diversity from the original tree and shrub plantings of the 1880s and 1890s, which is well-documented for conifers. Over the past quarter century there has also been a loss of eucalypt species, from over 125 species present in the early 1970s to fifty-one today. The school is already doing a superb restoration of the Arizona Garden, but we want to expand that for a broader restoration of the remaining areas of campus.`,

    For purpose of the RFP, the consultant is to provide a detailed work plan describing the process and the
    methodology to be employed in deriving the information requested. The City anticipates refinement of
    the final scope of services based on additional information contained in the responses to this RFP or
    information from the presentations made to the Corridor Staff Team by the finalists.
